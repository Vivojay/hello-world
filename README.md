# hello-world
This is my first github repo and here is my first python program for printing out *Lychrel numbers* based on a few parameters.
For info on Lychrel Numbers, check this [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number).

This is just a test program, I don't remember if it works or not...

Also, this is my second ever MD file (not counting reddit).
